## Hey there! My name is Mohd Shariq Khan.:grin: :metal:

I am a B.Tech graduate specialized in Computer Science and Engineering from India. I am passionate about Data Science. I'am currently learning Deep Learning using TensorFlow, a professional course from Coursera. Also I'am involved in developing my skills in Machine Learning. When I am not building models and writing codes, you can find me watching things on YouTube, watching Ramanujan's discoveries and Football. But most of my days are spent  listening to Music while doing Maths and Coding and watching TV Series/Movies.
